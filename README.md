## One-liner setup

Just type this into your terminal:

```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matteoscurati/midgulp/master/installer/install)"
```

After that your project has been deployed, you have to run:

    npm install
    bundle install

Then, edit your package.json.

##Start!

It's easy:

```
bundle exec middleman
```
